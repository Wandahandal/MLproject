This study explores the effectiveness of traditional machine learning classifiers and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the detection and classification of brain tumors using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. A dataset comprising MRI images of brain tumors categorized into four classes (glioma, meningioma, no tumor, and pituitary) was utilized. Traditional classifiers including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Adaboost were trained on handcrafted features extracted from MRI images using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) descriptors. Additionally, a CNN-based deep learning approach was employed for comparison. Results indicate that CNNs outperform traditional classifiers, achieving higher accuracy and robustness to variations in image quality and tumor characteristics. CNNs benefit from end-to-end training, enabling them to automatically learn discriminative features directly from raw input data, leading to more efficient and effective classification. These findings underscore the potential of deep learning techniques in revolutionizing brain tumor analysis, with implications for improving diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes in clinical settings.
